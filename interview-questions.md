# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is when the program reads everything as an object and functionality happens through built-in methods. Functional programming uses functions to make actions happen within a code. 

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming, also known as OOP, is the created outline developers have made to work with large software systems. It takes the code a breaks it up into containers so the code can be changed without messing with the entire code. The common montra for Ruby, which is an example of an OOP is "Everything is an object". Functional programming is a created approach to using functions to add, create, and build programs. JavaScript is a functional programming language. Although, object-oriented programming and functional programming both break down code to be edited without creating damage to the rest of the code, the main difference is that OOP focuses on objects to build code and functional programming focuses on creating functions to build code.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return is a return that the computer knows and automatically happens behind the scenes without having to be typed or placed within the code.

Researched answer: Ruby has implicit returns which means that if the execution path looks like its needing a return, there is no need to add the keyword "return". The saying "if it quacks like a duck and looks like a duck... it is a duck" reminds me of implicit returns, if the code says its next step has a return, looks like it'll have a return, than the computer knows whats in front of them and will return without having to write it.

<!-- I don't fully know if I could say that in an interview but it seems that in interviews they like to know how we think and that saying reminds me of the topic so I added it. Let me know if its alright or not to say that. -->

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is a encapsulated chunk of code that can either be passed to an object or to a Ruby method. A block is encapsulated by do and end or curly braces {}.

Researched answer: A block in Ruby is an anonymous function that gets passed to a method  using "do" and "end" or curcly braces {} to determine the outcome. Ruby blocks can have multiple arguments as they are piped (inside of ||). 

4. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, the developer would use square brackets with a colon inside followed by the key of the key:value pair to extract the value from the hash.
<!-- the colon inside the bracket notation is used to update a key:value pair, not extract a value from it -->

Researched answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, bracket notation is used. Inside the brackets you put the key name, the output will be the value of that key:value pair. 

5. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: I am not fully sure, but I do know a manager is in control so I'd like to say a version manager, manages the version of code being used in a specific coding language. 

Researched answer: A version manager keeps track of the changes made to files, like the type of file, size of file, deleting files, restoring files, etc.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: Also known as TDD, is a good-practice software development practice that suggests writing test before actually writing any code down. (Jest?!?!)

2. PostgreSQL: Postgres, one type of SQL looks at databases in the lens of object-oriented programming

3. CRUD: an acronym that stands for create, read, update, and delete.
